# Ponger
Ping Pong bot, now on steroids.

This bot replies to every "ping" with "pong".
There is a random chance that either the bot or the user will lose.
If the chances of the player losing and the bot losing are both high enough, the ball will explode, creating a tie scenario.

# How to use

## Add to server

### Best way: Use the "Add Bot" button on top of this file

- Title pretty much speaks for itself

### Other way: Self host

This bot is hosted on repl.it so you may want to follow [the idiot's guide](https://anidiots.guide/hosting/repl)

Just create a Repl from this repo and in the `.env` file add these lines:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=nYOURz.kBOTw.qTOKENx_kGOESd-gHEREp
```

Replace the values with your actual bot token.

For the hosting part follow the guide.

### Usage in a server

- Create a channel containing the phrase "ping-pong"
- Say "ping" and the bot will reply!
