# Ponger
Ping Pong bot, now on steroids.

# How to use

## Add to server

### Best way: Use the "Add Bot" button on top of this file

- Title pretty much speaks for itself

### Other way: Self host

This bot is hosted on repl.it so you may want to follow [the idiot's guide](https://anidiots.guide/hosting/repl)

Just create a Repl from this repo and in the `.env` file add these lines:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=nYOURz.kBOTw.qTOKENx_kGOESd-gHEREp
```

Replace the values with your actual bot token.

For the hosting part follow the guide.
